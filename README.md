## About

- **Status**: The app is ready for use and will continue to undergo occasional improvements.
- **Project idea**: After each of my friends had to download an app to settle our shared trip expenses, I decided to build this app to fill in this gap.
- **Project purpose**: As a Junior Web Developer open entry-level Web Developer roles, I aimed to both continue learning and showcase my skills while also creating a valuable tool for others to benefit from.

## Acknowledgements

- Shoutouts to [@jstayton](https://github.com/jstayton) and his truly amazing [piratepx](https://github.com/piratepx) tool. It's a super simple to implement yet powerful beauty providing exactly what I needed: privacy-respecting usage insights without spying on my users. I just love it, thanks!

## Learnings

- Initially, I dedicated more effort to setting up a modular project structure that aligns with industry conventions and best practices compared to my previous projects. While coding the app, I quickly realized its immense benefits, allowing me to add functionalities much easier and quicker.
- Building a Full Stack App from scratch for the very first time provided me with valuable insights into the fundamental mechanics of web applications.
- Most importantly, having learned JavaScript, Frontend and Backend fundamentals, I was uncertain about my initial career path. However, while coding this app, I quickly developed an appreciation for immediate visual results and recognized the beauty of React. Consequently, I have chosen to focus on Frontend as my initial career path.
