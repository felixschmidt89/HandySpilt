# InstantSplit

- User centered Full (MERN) Stack PWA designed for settling group expenses with a focus on functionality and data privacy, eliminating the need for personalized user registration or mandatory app installation.
- Allows gaining and sharing access to a group via a simple link and managing an unlimited number of such groups.
- Prioritizes privacy by not identifying or logging individual users and sessions and by purging all data of a group after 90 days of group inactivity.

## About

- **Project idea**: Frustrated with the need for each of my friends to download an app to settle our shared trip expenses, I decided to build InstantSplit to fill in the gap.
- **Project purpose**: In September 2023 while studying Web Development I took on this project to continue learning and showcase my coding skills while creating a practical tool for others.
- **Project status**:
  - fully functional since the release of the first MVP on 03/10/2023.
  - codebase, UI and UX have been widely improved after the first user tests in Q1 2024.
  - the app will continue to receive occasional improvements.
