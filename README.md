# InstantSplit

A user centered Full (MERN) Stack PWA designed for settling group expenses with a focus on functionality and data privacy, eliminating the need for personalized user registration or mandatory app installation. Allows gaining and sharing access to a group via a simple link and managing an unlimited number of such groups. Prioritizes privacy by not identifying or logging individual users and sessions and by purging all data of a group after 90 days of group inactivity.

## About

- **Project idea**: Frustrated with the need for each of my friends to download an app to settle our shared trip expenses, I decided to build InstantSplit to fill in the gap.
- **Project purpose**: In September 2023, when I was still a Web Development student, I took on this project to continue learning and showcase my coding skills while creating a practical tool for others.
- **Project status**:
  - The application has been fully functional since the release of the first MVP on 03/10/2023 and will continue to receive improvements.
  - Recently, both the codebase and the UI have been widely improved after the first user tests in January 2024
  - Further development will focus on improving UI/UX, adding unit tests, database encryption, server side refactoring & internalization (DE language)
