# InstantSplit

- User centered Full (MERN) Stack PWA designed for settling group expenses with a focus on functionality and data privacy, eliminating the need for personalized user registration or mandatory app installation.
- Allows gaining and sharing access to a group via a simple link and managing an unlimited number of such groups.
- Prioritizes privacy by not identifying or logging individual users and sessions and by purging all data of a group after 90 days of group inactivity.

## About

- **Project idea**: Frustrated with the need for each of my friends to download an app to settle our shared trip expenses, I decided to build InstantSplit to fill in the gap.
- **Project purpose**: In September 2023 I took on this project to continue learning and showcase my coding skills while creating a practical tool for others.

- **Project status**:
  - The application has been fully functional since the release of the first MVP on 03/10/2023 and will continue to receive improvements.
  - Recently, codebase, UI and UX have been widely improved after the first user tests in January 2024
  - Further development will focus on implementing database encryption, adding unit tests, and general server-side refactoring.
  - The next new core user functionality will be multi-currency expense tracking and daily currency rate conversion for settlement payments in a group's base currency.
